/*

    Right out of the gate before I dive into the review I just wanted to say
    how good the Pokedex looks! The additional features you added are really cool
    and the advanced filtering options that you implementing must have been pretty
    challenging to figure out. Additionally the individual pokemon pages with the
    color thief implementation and the stat progress bars are really cool.

    Some context for everyone else, Ja wasn't fully done with this iteration of the pokedex
    by the time I got around to reviewing it and is aware of many of the issues and
    refactoring that is needed. He just wanted to get eyes on it sooner vs later.
